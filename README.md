# Fast_Fourier_Transform


##### The script parses the sensor data files and subsequently performs FFT to observe temporal trends in the respiratory rates.


## Introduction

Fourier analysis converts a signal from its time domain to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. Fast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.

## Usage and expected results

To demonstrate our code, we will use a sample file (sample_sensor_data.txt).
